# duck-hunt-revenge
A VR game using the [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/) framework

## Play

The game can be played on both a VR headset and a PC (Chrome strongly recommended on PC)

The game has only been tested on Oculus Quest so the buttons assignment may be buggy on other headsets.

Be sure to access the website in https or the VR won't work.
